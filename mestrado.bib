  pages = {167--174},
  abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient pattern extraction algorithm that
	can be applied on melodic sequences that are represented as strings
	of abstract intervallic symbols; the melodic representation introduces
	special "don't care" symbols for intervals that may belong to two
	partially overlapping intervallic categories. As a special case the
	well established "step-leap" representation is examined. In the step-leap
	representation, each melodic diatonic interval is classified as a
	step (+-s), a leap (+-l) or a unison (u). Binary don't care symbols
	are introduced to represent the possible overlapping between the
	various abstract categories e.g. * = s, * = l and # = -s, # = -l.
	For such a sequence, we are interested in finding maximal repeating
	pairs and repetitions with a hole (two matching subsequences separated
	with an intervening non-matching symbol). We propose an O(n + d(n
	- d) + z )-time algorithm for computing all such repetitions in a
	given sequence x = x[1..n] with d binary don't care symbols, where
	z is the output size.},

	interest concerns the development of a CBR system for expressive

	similarity measure based on the I/R model for melodic structure and

	that the proposed measure provides a good compromise between discriminatory

  abstract = {In recent years the interest in melodic similarity has mushroomed
	mainly due to the increased importance of music information retrieval
	(MIR). A great number of similarity models and algorithms have been
	developed, but little or no attention has been paid to cognitive
	or perceptual aspects to the issue at hand. Questions, about the
	relevant parameters and the appropriate implementation are under-researched
	as are experimental data. This paper focuses on the pitch aspect
	of melodic similarity, scrutinising the term pitch replacing it by
	a less ambivalent and overused term, which we will call meloton.
	Based on the term meloton the paper suggests to approach the issue
	of 'melotonic' similarity from a transformational angle, where transformations
	are executed as reflections and translations. 'Melotonic' similarity
	then is seen as related to the transformation process in form of
	a transpositional and interval vector. Finally, melotonic similarity
	as portrait in a psychological context emerges as a multi-facet phenomenon
	requiring the development of flexible models.},

	who are unmusical, and that a scale numeric representation is easier
	than a contour one for those of moderate musical skill. Further,

	more accurate contour representation than if a user is asked to enter

	of a music similarity measure which we introduced in [2]. The technique
	aims at comparing music titles on the basis of their global "timbre",
	which has many applications in the field of Music Information Retrieval.
	Such measures of timbre similarity have seen a growing interest lately,
	and every contribution (including ours) is yet another instantiation
	of the same basic pattern recognition architecture, only with different
	algorithm variants and parameters. Most give encouraging results
	with a little effort, and imply that near-perfect results would just
	extrapolate by fine-tuning the algorithms' parameters. However, such
	systematic testing over large, inter-dependent parameter spaces is
	both difficult and costly, as it requires to work on a whole general
	meta-database architecture. This paper contributes in two ways to
	the current state of the art. We report on extensive tests over very
	many parameters and algorithmic variants, either already envisioned
	in the literature or not. This leads to an improvement over existing
	algorithms of about 15% R-precision. But most importantly, we describe
	many variants that surprisingly do not lead to any substancial improvement.
	Moreover, our simulations suggest the existence of a "glass ceiling"
	at R-precision about 65% which cannot probably be overcome by pursuing
	such variations on the same theme.},

  abstract = {Since plenty of digital files of music are available in the world
	wide web the search for melodies gains more and more importance.
	A mobile playback device like Apple's iPod is capable to store 5,000
	titles easily. Up to now single pieces of music are only found in
	such a volume knowing the title or interpret of a tune. However,
	it is a typical problem that someone searching a tune is not aware
	of this information and knows only the melody. Technically speaking
	this problem is a search in a music database. If the user only knows
	the melody, the melody should be provided to the search system. A
	query-by-humming system (QBH-system) provides this possibility: the

  year = {2003},

  abstract = {Theories of musical contour can be described as the study of the change
	in one musical parameter as a function of another. In my dissertation,
	contour theories proposed by Robert Morris, Michael Friedmann, Elizabeth
	Marvin, Paul Laprade, Ian Quinn, Robert John Clifford, Larry Polansky
	and Richard Bassein are reviewed. In general, these authors approach
	changes in pitch as a function of time. A commonality between these
	theories was shown to be the use of a system of pitch level identification
	based on the relative highness or lowness of the pitches, not based
	on actual pitch frequencies or pitch intervals in the melody. Additionally,
	these theories did not account for rhythmic or durational elements
	of the pitches as they are articulated in time. Music perception
	studies were cited that indicated that contour can play an important
	role in the recognition and memory of a melody, and that pitch interval
	and rhythmic components are vital elements in music understanding.
	Because these contour theories lacked the important musical elements
	of pitch and rhythm, an analytical method for the study of musical
	contour that incorporates both of these in its model of a melody
	is developed. This analytical method uses the mathematical technique
	of multiple linear regression to develop a model of the melody that
	can be graphed as representative of the contour of the actual melody.
	This method was used to analyze the first themes from the first movements
	of the nineteen piano sonatas composed by Mozart. Using regression
	modeling, the sonata melodies were categorized into two melody types:
	Type MD and Type LB. Analytical methods proposed by other theorists
	were then used to analyze selected melodies, and a comparison between
	the multiple linear regression model and these results was made.},

  abstract = { The support for audio in existing hypermedia systems is generally
	not as comprehensive as for text and images, considering audio to
	be an endpoint medium. Temporal linking has been considered in the
	Soundviewer for Microcosm. This linking model is beginning to become
	more mainstream through the development of standards associated with
	the World Wide Web, such as SMIL. This thesis investigates the application
	of content based navigation to music. It considers the viability
	of using melodic pitch contours as the content representation for
	retrieval and navigation. It observes the similarity between content
	based retrieval and navigation and focuses on the fast retrieval
	of music. The technique of using n-grams for efficient and accurate
	content based retrieval is explored. The classification of MIDI tracks
	into musical roles is used to reduce the amount of data that must
	be indexed, and so increase speed and accuracy. The impact of classification
	is evaluated against a melodic retrieval engine. Finally, the system
	built for retrieval is modified for navigation. A set of tools which
	support both temporal and content based navigation is built to provide
	proof of concept. },

  abstract = {The issue of how one should or might compare two or more events in
	atonal music has been a major concern --- either explicitly or implicitly
	--- in much music theoretical literature this century. While musical
	entities related by certain transformations (most notably transposition
	and inversion) have commonly been understood as equivalent, there
	is to date no commonly accepted method for comparing non-transformationally-related
	musical entities. In an attempt to bridge this gap, many theorists
	and composers have developed similarity measures or other constructs
	that are useful for relating two collections of notes (typically
	pitch classes). The first chapter of the dissertation provides a
	brief history and critique of various works in this field. The second
	chapter, which forms the theoretical heart of the dissertation,
	
	introduces several new similarity indices which take into account
	the degree of "saturation" that each element (interval class, subset
	class, or subset of an interval cycle) enjoys in a given set class.
	In order to examine the degree to which set X is saturated with element
	x, we compare the number of x's in X to the minimal and maximal amount
	of x that is possible in any set of the same size. The third and
	fourth chapters provide examples of how similarity indices can inform
	analyses of some post-tonal music. Chapter 3 is a comparative analysis
	of the first movement of Igor Stravinsky's Three Pieces for Clarinet
	Solo (1920) using eight different similarity indices. In Chapter
	4, the second movement of Olivier Messiaen's Petites esquisses d'oiseaux
	(1985) is analyzed through the lens of one of the similarity indices
	defined in chapter 2. The final chapter of the dissertation addresses
	some criticisms of similarity indices in particular and pitch-class
	based atonal analysis in general. It also provides the groundwork
	for extending the idea of elemental saturation into other domains,
	most notably "pitch-space", in which octave-related notes are not
	considered equivalent.},

	four overlapping strategies for approaching such 'off-tonic returns':

	the returning theme may be preceded by an applied chord which points
	to the theme's opening, non-tonic harmony; (3) the theme may return
	in the middle of a larger progression; or (4) the theme may be recomposed
	so as to start on the tonic when it returns. In many compositions,
	these various strategies have deep harmonic, motivic, or narrative
	implications. Beethoven was particularly adept in handling off-tonic
	returns, as may be witnessed in works such as his Concerto for Piano

	and analysis, and its application, via the implementation, to Schumann's
	Of Foreign Lands and People in Scenes from Childhood. Our immanent
	approach importantly includes the concept of contour similarity for
	different motif lengths making then possible to formalize the germinal
	motif (or leitmotif) concept. Based on motif, contour, gestalt, and
	motif similarity concepts, the crucial step in our mathematical model
	is indeed the introduction of neighborhoods of motives that include
	(similar) motives of different cardinalities and that yield a topological
	(T0 )-space on the set of all motives of a composition. In this space,
	the 'most dense' motif corresponds to the piece's 'germinal motif'.
	The model implementation (JAVA) constructs the spaces and in particular
	calculates, for each similarity threshold (neighborhood radius),
	the germinal motif; this is graphically represented in motivic evolution
	trees. The application to Of Foreign Lands and People briefy exemplifes
	our method.},

  abstract = {This paper is devoted to a qualitative and quantitative study of topological
	spaces built on premotif collections of musical scores. These motivic
	topologies are related to similarity concepts in the American music
	set theory. Through shapes, imitations and gestalts, and similarity
	relations between any two shapes, we obtain a motivic hierarchy f
	a score. This model of motivic analysis is completed by proposing
	different tools, such as weighted shapes and motivic evolution trees
	(MET), for visualizing these non-intuitive topologies. The concept
	MET, which is related to a systematic variation of the similarity
	parameter, is of a highly cognitive flavor.
	
	In the light of our approach, the still debated question concerning
	the length of the main theme in Bach's Kunst der Fuge is addressed.
	As a result, we can state that the extended 12-tone theme is essentially
	equivalent to the shorter 8-tone version when viewed from its motivic
	substance.},

	, a tape work composed in 1982 using only computer sound synthesis.
	The analysis is based on recorded traces of the compositional process
	(Music code listings, verbal and graphical annotations), and focuses
	on sound design criteria. It attempts to elucidate the connection
	between these criteria and the overall structure of the musical work.
	In short, it investigates the observable link between ''composing-the-sound''
	and ''composing-with-sounds'' in the making of Contours . The psychoacoustic
	relationship of pitch to timbre is crucial, and was a primary concern
	in all of Risset's operations in composing this work. In order to
	let a particular pitch contour either dissolve, or emerge from various
	timbral transformations, the composer devised several ad hoc sound
	design strategies strictly functional to the compositional concept.
	Further remarks are proposed concerning a twofold aesthetic dimension
	peculiar to this music: on the one hand, we have a legacy to the
	French tradition of musical impressionism; on the other, we have
	a more constructivist attitude, hidden behind what at first may sound
	as a decorative interplay of fascinating sound colors.},

	provided adjective ratings for each abstract. Similarity judgments
	were found to be context-specific and roughly equivalent for both
	types of listener, and were primarily based on more "surface" features
	such as dynamics, articulation, texture, and contour, rather than
	on "deeper" features such as motivic or harmonic relationships. The
	implications for music-theoretic views of similarity are discussed.

  title = {Expressivity-aware Tempo Transformations of Music Performances Using
	Case Based Reasoning},
  school = {University Pompeu Fabra},
  year = {2006},
  address = {Barcelona, Spain},
  month = {November},
  abstract = { This dissertation is about expressivity-aware tempo transformations
	of monophonic audio recordings of saxophone jazz performances. It
	is a contribution to content-based audio processing, a field of technology
	that has recently emerged as an answer to the increased need to deal
	intelligently with the ever growing amount of digital multimedia
	information available nowadays. Content-based audio processing applications
	may for example search a data base for music that has a particular
	instrumentation, or musical form, rather than just searching for
	music based on meta-data such as the artist, or title of the piece.
	Content-based audio processing also includes making changes to the
	audio to meet specific musical needs. The work presented here is
	an example of such content-based transformation. We have investigated
	the problem of how a musical performance played at a particular tempo
	can be rendered automatically at another tempo, while preserving
	naturally sounding expressivity. Or, differently stated, how does
	expressiveness change with global tempo. Changing the tempo of a
	given melody is a problem that cannot be reduced to just applying
	a uniform transformation to all the notes of the melody. The expressive
	resources for emphasizing the musical structure of the melody and
	the affective content differ depending on the performance tempo.
	We present a case based reasoning system to address this problem.
	It automatically performs melodic and expressive analysis, and it
	contains a set of examples of tempo-transformations, and when a new
	musical performance must be tempo-transformed, it uses the most similar
	example tempo-transformation to infer the changes of expressivity
	that are necessary to make the result sound natural. We have validated
	the system experimentally, and show that expressivity-aware tempotransformation
	are more similar to human performances than tempo transformations
	obtained by uniform time stretching, the current standard technique
	for tempo transformation. Apart from this contribution as an intelligent
	audio processing application prototype, several other contributions
	have been made in this dissertation. Firstly, we present a representation
	scheme of musical expressivity that is substantially more elaborate
	than existing representations, and we describe a technique to automatically
	annotate music performances using this representation scheme. This
	is an important step towards fullyautomatic case acquisition for
	musical CBR applications. Secondly, our method reusing past cases
	provides an example of solving synthetic tasks with multi-layered
	sequential data, a kind of task that has not been explored much in
	case based reasoning research. Thirdly, we introduce a similarity
	measure for melodies that computes similarity based on an semi-abstract
	musical level. In a comparison with other state-of-the-art melodic
	similarity techniques, this similarity measure gave the best results.
	Lastly, a novel evaluation methodology is presented to assess the
	quality of predictive models of musical expressivity. },

  number = {3},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT Schenkerian analysis is a problematic tool for the analysis
	of early modernist music, not least because its deep-level theoretical
	and hermeneutic dependence on the Beethovenian heroic style is at
	risk of predefining the outline of a hermeneutics of other music.
	By bringing the Ursatz into contact with Martin Heidegger's concept
	of the Augenblick, it becomes possible to sever this restrictive
	hermeneutic link and also to open up a radically new possibility
	for background structures in late tonal music. Elgar's First Symphony
	presents two considerable challenges to an orthodox Schenkerian reading.
	First, it is a prolongation of two strongly outlined tonalities -
	one immuring, the other immured - and second, its Kopfton remains
	static at the end of movements and does not descend structurally
	until the finale, thus prolonging a single Ursatz over an entire
	symphony. By aligning itself with Heidegger's analysis of the nature
	of human Being, a Heideggerian-Schenkerian analysis of the work illuminates
	Elgar's 'play' with the Beethovenian symphonic tradition, and demonstrates
	how he successfully manipulates his gigantic early modernist tonal
	structure.},

  abstract = {The advance of music information retrieval (MIR) has brought about
	a strong interest in melodic similarity models. In fact, the majority
	of these models derive their rational from the implementation within
	a MIR context. This is, so authors argue in general, a model is suitable
	if it retrieves the desired melody or a close variation of it. This
	post hoc method does not permit the evaluation and comparison of
	these models (although such a "comparison" competition has been proposed
	for ISMIR 2005). The author of this paper approaches the issue form
	a different angle; rather than testing models in an unsystematic
	fashion, the author will discuss the underlying cognitive principles
	of the similarity models. Here, it will be shown that four principle
	strategies exist: The contrast models, the distance models, dynamic
	programming and transition matrices. The author will then demonstrate
	that a variety of distance measures based upon a specific representation
	of melodies appears most promising while insisting that no single
	measurement can be seen as the answer to everything.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel form of representing musical durations
	(which we will call chronota) of melodies in from of chains based
	on atomic beats. This is, a melody consisting of quarter, eighth
	and sixteenth notes fetches the sixteenth as its atomic beat, where
	all other durations are represented as multiples of the sixteenth
	notes. This form of representation makes it possible to depicted
	musical durations geometrically in a 2-dimensional space. Depicting
	two rhythms (sequences of durations called chains here) in this representational
	system, rhythmic similarity (called chronotonic similarity here)
	is seen as being correlated to how much two rhythms deviate in shape
	via a transformation mechanism. A similarity model based on this
	form of representation predicts specifically the following scenarios.
	(A) a quarter note compared to two eighths notes (split ratio 1:1)
	fetches smaller similarity ratings than a quarter note compared to
	a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note (split ratio 1:3), (b)
	reversing two sequences produces the same similarity rating as the
	original sequences (c) longer sequences fetch higher similarity ratings,
	(d) tempo change affects similarity ratings, (e) comparison order
	has no effect, and (f) complex sequences compared with simple sequences
	fetch low similarity ratings. The model was put to its test within
	an experiment. It was found that the model appears to be supported
	by the results as obtained in this experiment. In fact inputting
	all data of the experiment into the model, produced a high correlation.
	Moreover, all predictions of the model were supported by the experiment
	except of one trial (comparison order) which fetched small negative
	significance.},

  review = {In this remarkable book, Antony Hopkins shows how the entire orchestra
	acts as a distinct musical instrument, one which composers have played
	upon over the centuries to express every mood, from the most sublime
	to the most frivolous. In so doing, he explains the ways in which
	a composer's "signature in sound" develops, from the subtly exotic
	pattern of a Bartok theme to the sensuously evocative chords in Debussy.
	Hopkins offers an in-depth look at the origins of the orchestra itself,
	an evolutionary process that took the better part of two centuries
	in Europe, yet finds its roots in our ancient past. He begins his
	discussion in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, moves through the
	music of medieval Europe, and ultimately reaches a watershed moment
	in the history of the orchestra as we now know it: the composition
	of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos in the early eighteenth century.
	Having introduced the various instruments, explained the development
	of their groupings, and demonstrated how the blending of their tones
	led to the orchestral sounds of the modern era, he provides an incisive
	examination of actual compositions. Expertly guiding readers through
	representative pieces by Mozart, Schubert, Berlioz, Tchaikovsky,
	Debussy, and Britten, Hopkins offers a unique and insightful companion
	for beginning and more seasoned concert-goers alike.},

  abstract = {Music theorists have studied intervallic properties of pitch-class
	sets for more than three decades. It is held that a function measuring

	(1) provide a distinct value for every pair of sets; (2) be useful
	for sets of any size; and (3) provide a wide range of discrete values.
	On the basis of these criteria, measures of Teitelbaum, Forte, Morris,
	Rahn, Lewin, and Lord are found to be inadequate, and a new function,
	IcVSIM (for Interval-class Vector SIMilarity), is proposed. The function
	returns as its value the standard deviation of the entries in the
	Interval-difference Vector (IdV) of two sets. The IdV is formed by
	computing the difference between the terms of two ic-vectors. A value
	of 0.00 indicates maximum similarity with respect to interval-class
	content. Z-related sets and certain pairs of sets of different sizes
	are found to be maximally similar, while sets 6-35 (the whole-tone
	collection) and 8-28 (the octatonic collection) are more dissimilar
	than any other pair of sets of size 3 through 9, with an IcVSIM value

	and a variety of methods have been proposed for calculating such
	measures. This paper describes a system for music similarity which
	attempts to model and compare some of the more musically salient
	features of a set of audio signals. A model for timbre and a model
	for rhythm are implemented directly from previous work, and a model
	for song structure is developed. The different models are weighted
	and combined to provide an overall music similarity measure. The
	system is tested on a small set of popular music files spanning eleven
	different genres. The system is tuned to estimate genre boundaries
	using multidimensional scaling? a technique that allows for quick
	visualization of similarity data. An "automatic DJ" application,
	that generates playlists based on the music similarity models, serves
	as a subjective evaluation for the system.},

  title = {Computational Musical Instrument Recognition and Its Application
	to Content-based Music Information Retrieval},
  school = {Kyoto University},
  year = {2007},
  address = {Japan},
  month = {March},
  abstract = {The current capability of computers to recognize auditory events is
	severely limited when compared to human ability. Although computers
	can accurately recognize sounds that are sufficiently close to those
	trained in advance and that occur without other sounds simultaneously,
	they break down whenever the inputs are degraded by competing sounds.
	In this thesis, we address computational recognition of non-percussive
	musical instruments in polyphonic music. Music is a good domain for
	computational recognition of auditory events because multiple instruments
	are usually played simultaneously. The difficulty in handling music
	resides in the fact that signals (events to be recognized) and noises
	(events to be ignored) are not uniquely defined. This is the main
	difference from studies of speech recognition under noisy environments.
	Musical instrument recognition is also important from an industrial
	standpoint. The recent development of digital audio and network technologies
	has enabled us to handle a tremendous number of musical pieces and
	therefore efficient music information retrieval (MIR) is required.
	Musical instrument recognition will serve as one of the key technologies
	for sophisticated MIR because the types of instruments played characterize
	musical pieces; some musical forms, in fact, are based on instruments,
	for example "piano sonata" and "string quartet." Despite the importance
	of musical instrument recognition, studies have until recently mainly
	dealt with monophonic sounds. Although the number of studies dealing
	with polyphonic music has been increasing, their techniques have
	not yet achieved a sufficient level to be applied to MIR or other
	real applications. We investigate musical instrument recognition
	in two stages. At the first stage, we address instrument recognition
	for monophonic sounds to develop basic technologies for handling
	musical instrument sounds. In instrument recognition for monophonic
	sounds, we deal with two issues: (1) the pitch dependency of timbre
	and (2) the input of non-registered instruments. Because musical
	instrument sounds have wide pitch ranges in contrast to other kinds
	of sounds, the pitch dependency of timbre is an important issue.
	The second issue, that is, handling instruments that are not contained
	in training data, is also an inevitable problem. This is because
	it is impossible in practice to build a thorough training data set
	due to a virtually infinite number of instruments. At the second
	stage, we address instrument recognition in polyphonic music. To
	deal with polyphonic music, we must solve the following two issues:
	(3) the overlapping of simultaneously played notes and (4) the unreliability
	of precedent note estimation process. When multiple instruments simultaneously
	play, partials (harmonic components) of their sounds overlap and
	interfere. This makes the acoustic features different from those
	of monophonic sounds. The overlapping of simultaneous notes is therefore
	an essential problem for polyphonic music. In addition, note estimation,
	that is, estimating the onset time and fundamental frequency (F0)
	of each note, is usually used as a preprocess in a typical instrument
	recognition framework. It remains, however, a challenging problem
	for polyphonic music. In Chapter 3, we propose an F0-dependent multivariate
	normal distribution to resolve the first issue. The F0-dependent
	multivariate normal distribution is an extension of a multivariate
	normal distribution where the mean vector is defined as a function
	of F0. The key idea behind this is to approximate variation of each
	acoustic feature from pitch to pitch as a function of F0. This approximation
	makes it possible to separately model the pitch and non-pitch dependencies
	of timbres. We also investigate acoustic features for musical instrument
	recognition in this chapter. Experimental results with 6,247 solo
	tones of 19 instruments showed improvement of the recognition rate
	from 75.73% to 79.73% on average. In Chapter 4, we solve the second
	issue by recognizing non-registered instruments at the category level.
	When a given sound is registered, its instrument name, e.g. violin,
	is recognized. Even if it is not registered, its category name, e.g.
	strings, can be recognized. The important issue in achieving such
	recognition is to adopt a musical instrument taxonomy that reflects
	acoustical similarity. We present a method for acquiring such a taxonomy
	by applying hierarchical clustering to a large-scale musical instrument
	sound database. Experimental results showed that around 77% of non-registered
	instrument sounds, on average, were correctly recognized at the category
	level. In Chapter 5, we tackle the third issue by weighting features
	based on how much they are affected by overlapping; that is, we give
	lower weights to features affected more and higher weights to features
	affected less. For this kind of weighting, we have to evaluate the
	influence of the overlapping on each feature. It was, however, impossiblein
	previous studies to evaluate the influence by analyzing training
	data because the training data were only taken from monophonic sounds.
	Taking training data from polyphonic music (called a mixed-sound
	template), we evaluate the influence as the ratio of the within-class
	variance to the between-class variance in the distribution of the
	training data. We then generate feature axes using a weighted mixture
	that minimizes the influence by means of linear discriminant analysis.
	We also introduced musical context to avoid musically unnatural errors
	(e.g., only one clarinet note within a sequence of flute notes).
	Experimental results showed that the recognition rates obtained using
	the above were 84.1% for duo music, 77.6% for trio music, and 72.3%
	for quartet music. In Chapter 6, we describe a new framework of musical
	instrument recognition to solve the fourth issue. We formulate musical
	instrument recognition as the problem of calculating instrument existence
	probabilities at every point on the time-frequency plane. The instrument
	existence probabilities are calculated by multiplying two kinds of
	probabilities, one of which is calculated using the PreFEst and the
	other of which is calculated using hidden Markov models. The instrument
	existence probabilities are visualized in the spectrogram-like graphical
	representation called the instrogram. Because the calculation is
	performed for each time and each frequency, not for each note, estimation
	of the onset time and F0 of each note is not necessary. We obtained
	promising results for both synthesized music and recordings of real
	performances of classical and jazz music. In Chapter 7, we describe
	an application of the instrogram analysis to similarity-based MIR.
	Because most previous similarity-based MIR systems used low-level
	features such as MFCCs, similarities for musical elements such as
	the melody, rhythm, harmony, and instrumentation could not be separately
	measured. As the first step toward measuring such music similarity,
	we develop a music similarity measure that reflects instrumentation
	only based on the instrogram representation. We confirmed that the
	instrogram can be applied to content-based MIR by developing a prototype
	system that searches for musical pieces that have instrumentation
	similar to that specified by the user. In Chapter 8, we discuss the
	major contributions of this study toward research fields including
	computational auditory scene analysis, content-based MIR, and music
	visualization. We also discuss remaining issues and future directions
	of research. Finally, we present our conclusions of this work in
	Chapter 9.},

  abstract = {A síntese sonora em software está intimamente ligada aos programas
	da família Music N iniciados pelo Music I em 1957. Apesar de seus
	méritos, como as unidades geradoras e a flexibilidade de uma linguagem
	de partitura, o Music N apresenta alguns problemas como limitações
	na reutilização de instrumentos, inflexibilidade de parâmetros, falta
	de linguagem gráfica, e normalmente apenas um paradigma para partituras.
	Algumas soluções concentram-se em novas implementações da Music N,
	enquanto outras concentram-se na criação de ferramentas auxiliares
	como pré-processadores, e utilitários gráficos. Contudo as novas
	implementações em geral concentram-se em grupos de problemas específicos,
	sem resolver outros; e as ferramentas auxiliares resolvem um único
	problema sem ligação com os demais. Neste trabalho nós investigamos
	o problema da criação de uma meta-linguagem para síntese sonora capaz
	de utilizar diferentes paradigmas tais como unidades geradoras e
	execução de programas externos. A criação de uma meta-linguagem para
	síntese sonora permite uma solução elegante para os problemas colocados,
	sem a necessidade de implementar um novo compilador acústico, e permite
	uma integração difícil de ser alcançada com o uso dos utilitários
	atuais.},

  abstract = {Vitanyi and his co-workers [5] have reported some success using a
	universal similarity metric based on Kolmogorov complexity for a
	variety of classification tasks, including music genre recognition.
	This paper describes new experiments in this direction, and compares
	the results with some alternative approaches. Somewhat to our surprise
	given its non-specific universal nature, the Kolmogorov complexity
	similarity based technique outperformed the others. The task used
	for our experiments involved classification of MIDI files into one
	of 4 groups. Two of the categories were western classical music composed
	by Beethoven (302 files) and Haydn (261 files). The remaining categories
	were Chinese music (80 files) and Jazz (128 files). Melody contours
	(i.e. pitch sequences without timing details) were extracted from
	the MIDI file tracks. Both relative and absolute and pitch contours
	were used. The best performance of 92.35% was achieved by a 1-nearest
	neighbour classifer with normalized information distance based on
	Kolmogorov complexity estimates over pitch interval contours. A notable
	feature of our work is the use of the number of blocks in a pure
	Lempel-Zip parse of a string to estimate its Kolmogorov complexity.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a computationally efficient method for quantifying
	the degree of tonal similarity between two pieces of music. The properties
	we examine are key frequencies and average time in key, and we propose
	two metrics, based on the L1 and L2 norms, for quantifying similarity
	using these descriptors. The methods are applied to 711 classical
	themes and variations over 71 variation sets by 10 composers of different
	genres. Quantile-quantile plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov measure
	show that the proposed metrics exhibit strongly distinct behaviour
	when assessing pieces from the same variation set, and those that
	are not. Comparisons across variation sets by the same composer,
	and comparisons of pieces by different composers although result
	in similar distributions, are derived from fundamentally different
	underlying distributions, according to the K-S measure. We present
	probabilistic analyses of the two methods based on the distributions
	derived empirically. When the discrimination threshold is set at
	55, the probabilities of Type I and Type II errors are 18.41% and
	20.56% respectively for Method 1, and 15.72% and 22.94% respectively
	for Method 2. Method 1 has a success rate of 99.48% when labeling
	pieces as dissimilar (not from the same variation set), while the
	corresponding rate for Method 2 is 99.45%.},

  abstract = {A novel software system that automatically classifies musical recordings
	based on genre is presented and discussed. This system is intended
	as a demonstration of how automated musical feature extraction from
	MIDI files, machine learning and pattern recognition techniques can
	be applied to the general tasks of music classification and grouping.
	
	The nebulous definitions and overlapping boundaries of genres makes
	reliable and consistent genre classification a difficult task for
	humans and computers alike. Traditional rules-based classification
	systems are severely limited by these factors as well as by the dynamic
	nature of genres. The techniques used in this software system are
	presented as alternative methods that can help to overcome these
	limitations.
	
	Arriving at a realistic and useful musical taxonomy can also be a
	difficult task. The problems associated with this task are briefly
	reviewed and some possible ways in which technology can be applied
	to improve the process of taxonomy construction are presented.
	
	The highlights of the catalogue of musical features that the software
	extracts from symbolic musical data are presented in the context
	of how the features can be used both for automatic classification
	and for statistical musicological studies. The easy to use and flexible
	interface of the software is also demonstrated as a resource that
	could easily be adapted to a variety of areas of musical research.
	Several automated pattern recognition and classification techniques
	are also briefly presented in order to demonstrate how they can be
	applied to musical research.},

  abstract = { ABSTRACT A defining feature of Viennese ballroom minuets in the second
	half of the eighteenth century is the marked contrast between the
	first and second minuet (commonly called the trio). The type of contrast
	was standardised within a rather narrow and predictable range. Minuets
	were loud, employed the full orchestra and had walking bass lines
	in predominantly crotchet motion. Trios were soft, employed a reduced
	orchestra and used a slower harmonic rhythm. Focusing on Mozart's
	minuets written for the ballroom, an argument is advanced as to why
	such sharp contrast might have been desirable. Drawing on historical
	and analytical evidence, it is suggested that the music of the first
	minuet establishes the historical authority, political power and
	social status of the participants of the dance, while the trio is
	centred artistically on the grace and beauty displayed by the individual
	couple on the ballroom dance floor. },

	and discovering music. The main part consists of two chapters. Chapter
	2 gives an introduction to computational models of music similarity.
	The combination of different approaches is optimized and the largest
	evaluation of music similarity measures published to date is presented.
	The best combination performs significantly better than the baseline
	approach in most of the evaluation categories. A particular effort
	is made to avoid overfitting. To cross-check the results from the
	evaluation based on genre classification a listening test is conducted.
	The test confirms that genre-based evaluations are suitable to efficiently
	evaluate large parameter spaces. Chapter 2 ends with recommendations
	on the use of similarity measures. Chapter 3 describes three applications
	of such similarity measures. The first application demonstrates how
	music collections can be organized and visualized so that users can
	control the aspect of similarity they are interested in. The second
	application demonstrates how music collections can be organized hierarchically
	into overlapping groups at the artist level. These groups are summarized
	using words from web pages associated with the respective artists.
	The third application demonstrates how playlists can be generated
	which require minimum user input.},

  title = {Harmonic Modeling for Polyphonic Music Retrieval},
  school = {University of Massachusetts Amherst},
  year = {2004},
  address = {MA, USA},
  month = {May},
  abstract = { The content-based retrieval of Western music has received increasing
	attention in recent years. While much of this research deals with
	monophonic music, polyphonic music is far more common and more interesting,
	encompassing a wide selection of classical to popular music. Polyphony
	is also far more complex, with multiple overlapping notes per time
	step, in comparison with monophonic music's one-dimensional sequence
	of notes. Many of the techniques developed for monophonic music retrieval
	either break down or are simply not applicable to polyphony. The
	first problem one encounters is that of vocabulary, or feature selection.
	How does one extract useful features from a polyphonic piece of music?
	The second problem is one of similarity. What is an effective method
	for determining the similarity or relevance of a music piece to a
	music query using the features that we have chosen? In this work
	we develop two approaches to solve these problems. The first approach,
	hidden Markov modeling, integrates feature extraction and probabilistic
	modeling into a single, formally sound framework. However, we feel
	these models tend to overfit the music pieces on which they were
	trained and, while useful, are limited in their effectiveness. Therefore,
	we develop a second approach, harmonic modeling, which decouples
	the feature extraction from the probabilistic sequence modeling.
	This allows us more control over the observable data and the aspects
	of it that are used for sequential probability estimation. Our systems
	- the first of their kind - are able to not only retrieve real-world
	polyphonic music variations using polyphonic queries, but also bridge
	the audio-symbolic divide by using imperfectlytranscribed audio queries
	to retrieve error-free symbolic pieces of music at an extremely high
	precision rate. In support of this work we offer a comprehensive
	evaluation of our systems. },

	to be of musical interest. We assume that contour may be applied
	to any parameter of music, at any hierarchical level. These ideas

  abstract = {O Teatro São João da cidade de Salvador (BA) funcionou entre 1812
	e 1922. Nele circularam, além dos artistas, todos os estratos da
	sociedade baiana. Recentemente foi encontrada, na seção colonial
	do Arquivo Público do Estado da Bahia, uma documentação inédita referente
	ao período de criação e estabelecimento do teatro (1806 a 1821).
	Este material está distribuído em oito maços de documentos, em diferentes
	formatos e tamanhos, referentes à construção e ao funcionamento administrativo
	e artístico do teatro. A grande quantidade de informações contida
	nos maços é bastante fragmentária, dificultando o estudo sistematizado
	de tal documentação. O material encontrado fornece informações referentes
	a artistas e apresentações, apesar de não se tratar de documentação
	musical (programas de concerto, partitura). Para tanto foi necessário
	resolver o problema da fragmentação das informações, com a criação
	de, numa primeira etapa, um sistema de códigos de localização de
	informações arquivais, e, numa segunda etapa, um sistema informatizado
	de disponibilização de informações. A partir do conteúdo dos maços
	encontrados, desenvolvemos uma classificação própria que leva em
	conta o sistema de organização utilizado pelo Arquivo Público do
	Estado da Bahia, além de permitir a inclusão de novos documentos,
	originários de outros arquivos ou instituições. Após esta etapa,
	iniciamos desenvolvimento do sistema que, em uma primeira versão,
	contempla apenas informações relativas a artistas. Para seu desenvolvimento
	levamos em conta as necessidades de consulta do material e a futura
	conexão com outras bases de dados construídas em pesquisas na área
	de Musicologia na Bahia, como a desenvolvida por Pablo Sotuyo Blanco,
	sobre o Patrimônio Musical na Bahia e a coordenada por Manuel Veiga,
	sobre Impressão Musical na Bahia. Além de apresentar soluções aos
	problemas inerentes ao gerenciamento das informações encontradas,
	o presente projeto de pesquisa fornece subsídios para uma abordagem
	sociológica do Teatro São João. Adotando o conceito de figuração,
	desenvolvido por Norbert Elias, todas as pessoas envolvidas com o
	teatro passam a constituir uma formação social em que os indivíduos
	estão ligados entre si por meio de dependências recíprocas, tendo,
	neste caso, o teatro como centro. Tal abordagem transcende as fronteiras
	tradicionais da Musicologia Histórica, porém, faz-se necessária para
	uma melhor compreensão da Música e dos músicos durante este período
	da vida cultural brasileira.},

  abstract = {The purpose of these experiments was twofold: The general purpose
	was to further investigate the properties of the phonological loop
	by extending the irrelevant sound effect paradigm to music (Schendel
	& Palmer, in press). The specific purpose was to investigate the
	similarity of content (Salame & Baddley, 1982; 1989) and similarity
	of process (Jones & Macken, 1993; 1995) hypotheses of working memory
	in order to determine which could best account for the irrelevant
	sound effects in both language and music. Experiment I consisted
	of serial recall of visually-presented nine-digit or nine-note sequences
	in the presence of irrelevant silence, instrumental music, vocal
	music, or Arabic speech. Experiment IIA and IIB used a six-digit
	or four-tone standard/comparison task with a retention interval under
	the same irrelevant sound conditions. Experiment III used the same
	procedure as IIA, but the irrelevant sound conditions were silence,
	low-overlap, and high-overlap sounds. In every experiment, a greater
	acoustic overlap between the to-be-remembered and to-be-ignored stimuli
	resulted in greater performance decrements. Aspects of both the similarity
	of process and similarity of content models were supported and integrated
	into a new model termed the Acoustic Overlap hypothesis which can
	more accurately account for the current findings.},

  abstract = {According to Western music theory, familiar melodies containing alterations
	which shift them a long distance (harmonically) from the original
	should be considered perceptually dissimilar relative to the original.
	It is possible to obtain such a large shift with a small change in
	melodic pitch. However, this creates a paradox with pitch (contour)
	shifting, which is known to reduce similarity minimally if the distance
	from the original is small. We investigated the hypotheses that (1)
	manipulations to contour and implied harmony of an original melody
	reduce similarity scores and (2) novices are less sensitive to implied
	harmony changes than experts, but as sensitive as experts to contour
	manipulations. Twenty-eight novices and 44 expert musicians rated
	similarity of familiar nursery rhyme tunes compared with close and
	distant harmonic transformations plus close and distant pitch shifts.
	Results indicated that both groups use contour (pitch distance) to
	determine similarity, but that musically experienced listeners also
	use implied harmony to make further distinctions. It is argued that
	as listeners become more experienced, they rely on more sophisticated
	strategies for encoding and organizing melodies in memory, with deeper
	structural aspects of music being used when other strategies such
	as contour are uninformative or non-distinctive. These new findings,
	that contour and harmony affect judged similarity for simple, familiar
	melodies, have implications for theories of memory for music, and
	for the design of automated music retrieval and data mining systems.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses a system that operates on the WWW and retrieves
	the song title from the melody of a song. In retrieval from a sung
	tune, it is not always true that the input melody information (such
	as pitch and span) is exact. The result of coarse conversion of the
	input data to the melody information based on thresholds is used
	as the retrieval key, and the matching to a song in the database
	is attempted. It has been difficult, however, to define adequate
	thresholds. In particular, it has been difficult to derive effective
	retrieval keys for the span. It has also been difficult to make the
	process converge toward the correct solution by using the coarse
	information. From such a viewpoint, this study proposes the following
	two approaches in matching: (1) A method is presented to set optimal
	thresholds for deriving an effective retrieval key. (2) A matching
	procedure to restrict precisely the candidates for the correct song
	from the database song is presented. Retrieval with a higher matching
	accuracy than in the conventional method is realized, and a system
	that can be utilized by multiple users on the WWW is constructed.

  abstract = {The field of Music Information Retrieval research is concerned with
	the problem of locating pieces of music by content, for example,
	finding the best matches in a collection of music to a particular
	melody fragment. This is useful for applications such as copyright-related
	searches. In this work we investigate methods for the retrieval of
	polyphonic music stored as musical performance data using the MIDI
	standard file format. We devised a three-stage approach to melody
	matching consisting of melody extraction, melody standardisation,
	and similarity measurement. We analyse the nature of musical data,
	compare several novel melody extraction techniques, describe many
	melody standardisation techniques, develop, and compare various melody
	similarity measurement techniques, and also develop a method for
	evaluating the techniques in terms of the quality of answers retrieved,
	based on approaches developed withing the Information Retrieval community.
	We have found that a technique that was judged to work well for extracting
	melodies consists of selecting the highest pitch note that starts
	at each instant. We have tested a variety of methods for locating
	similar pieces of music. The best techniques found thus far are local
	alignment of intervals and coordinate matching based on n-grams,
	with n from 5 to 7. In addition, we have compiled a collection of
	MIDI files, the representations of automatically extracted melodies
	of these files, a query set based on the extracted melodies, a collection
	of manual queries, and inferred and human relevance judgements. Experiments
	using these sets show that the type of query used in testing a system
	makes a significant difference in the outcome of an evaluation. Specifically,
	we found that manual queries performed best with a representation
	of the music collection that keeps a "melody" extracted from each
	instrumental part, and short automatically generated queries performed
	better when matched agains a representation of the collection that,
	for each piece, uses the melody extraction approach described above.},

	of melody databases}},
  journal = {Multimedia Signal Processing, 2002 IEEE Workshop on},
  year = {2002},
  pages = {249--252},
  abstract = {Music query-by-humming is a challenging problem since the humming
	query inevitably contains much variation and inaccuracy. Many of
	the previous methods, which adopt note segmentation and string matching
	with dynamic programming, suffer drastically from the errors in the
	note segmentation which affects retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
	In this paper, we present a novel melody similarity matching technique
	which is based on continuous melody contour. The continuous melody
	contour has many advantages over previous string based melody representation.
	We introduce a contour alignment technique which addresses the robustness
	and efficiency issues. We also present a new melody similarity metric
	which is performed directly on continuous melody contours of the
	query data. This approach cleanly separates the alignment and similarity
	measurement in the retrieval process. We show how to robustly and
	efficiently align the query melody with the reference melodies and
	how to measure the similarity subsequently. Our melody alignment
	method can reduce the matching candidate to 1.7% with 90% correct
	alignment rate. The overall retrieval system achieved 80% correct
	retrieval in the top 10 rank list.},
